                This was a really formative project. Before I even started working on these posters I was to research a
                randomly assigned graphic designer. I got Milton Glaser. I went into this having absolutely no knowledge
                whatsoever of him or his work. I studied his life and work and it was really captivating. I genuinely
                found a lot of inspiration in him. I felt I aspired to do things he had done, like studying in Florence,
                Italy. So, the final for this course was not only the research, but creating posters that, ‘aren’t a
                direct copy, but if you two had worked on it together, combining styles’. I added the pieces I took
                inspiration from below. In all my time at NIU this was my favorite. We could only use elements we made,
                for the left one I printed flash photos I took of different mediums of music, then colored over them and
                scanned them in again. The pattern on the right poster was something we made in a previous project and
                we were encouraged to use the assests we made throughout the semester in our finals somehow.<br /><br />Below
                are the original posters that were chosen for inspiration.
