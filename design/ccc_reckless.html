                This was a semester long project where I was to rebrand a business, fictional or real. I chose Chicago
                local business Reckless Records. Solely because they have no branding whatsoever. I wanted it to portray
                how the physical stores feel. Thereâ€™s this grunge-like aesthetic. I want it to be contemporary and kinda
                vintage. I feel you can see that in the designs I made. We also had to do designs for an event. I did
                record store day as it is a fitting event for the business.

                So, I was simultaneously in a web deisgn course that also had a rebrand project. I put the two together
                to make this one big project. I actually created a functioning site. I wanted to really polish it and do
                a lot but my professor said I was doing too much and to move on. In a universe where I have all the time
                in the world, I will finish it for fun :) <br /><br />

                Until then here are some screenshots of the site.
