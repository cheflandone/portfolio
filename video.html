          <p id="supercutcaption2">I’ve been making these for years. But in 2021 my world imploded, as it does for many 19 year olds. This led to a very intense and eventful year in 2022 which prompted me to take this form of documentary and not just make it a corny montage, but turn it into an art piece itself. Playing with composition and building a cinematic experience that captures what it really is to be ‘coming of age’ in the 21st century. <br><br>

          As someone who is really dorky with technical stuff like video encoding and audio mixing I use this as an exercise to practice and perfect the quality of these short films.<br><br>

          This is my passion project, my thesis, and my legacy. I want to take these memories and present it how I feel it. A glorious kaleidoscope of love, liberation, and the fear that comes with growing into yourself.<br><br>

          In 2023, I spent the entire year intently recording moments + b-roll like scenery to build a more cohesive narrative + setting. I divided it up into chapters signifying important moments in my life. <br>For example, a few were things like, moving to a very queer neighborhood, beginning a relationship, and ending the relationship when I realized I had to stand up for myself, the liberation that followed, a difficult semester in school that led to serious burnout. These were things that mean a lot to me on a personal level.</p>

          <p id="mvcaption">This was my first attempt at making a music video. Looking back even though its been only two years, there's a lot I would do differently. But I feel it is important to include in this portfolio because it still shows I'm capable of these things. I also had a really fun time doing it with my friend Paige. We're discussing making more and that excites me :)</p>
