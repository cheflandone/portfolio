                    This time is different.<br /><br />I wanted to convey the idea of running through fire. This can be
                    broken down many ways which is the intention, it can be about fear, pain, grief or it can be about
                    exhilaration, adrenaline, burning the pieces that don’t fit anymore. Creation in destruction is the
                    most beautiful thing. I know what I am talking about is not unique to me. But I’m twenty-two so I
                    get to be young and dramatic.

                    Since I was handed a camera as a child I have been making videos. While I most definitely used to
                    make videos of me lip-syncing and dancing in my room, and made comedy sketches with my brothers, the
                    most important form of these videos to me was still documentary. Capturing my life and presenting in
                    a way that reflects how I perceive it. After making videos for over a decade, I’ve finally got a
                    clearer idea of how I want to make these now that I have some experience and better tools at my
                    disposal. So in 2021 my world imploded, as it does for many 19 year olds. But I was for the first
                    time in my life, in touch with my sense of self. I wanted to turn these videos I’m always making,
                    that then didn’t have much substance, into a statement. Each year having its own general theme,
                    laced in details that created a mosaic of my life and how I felt in those moments.<br /><br />TL;DR
                    this is how I make sense of my own life, and present it.

                    For Paige's debut record <i>Without Fear of Wind or Vertigo</i>, we shot a music video for the track
                    <i>Irresistible</i>. We walked around her neighborhood and shot a lot of footage to compile later with a
                    rather loose concept. We were inspired by Lana Del Rey's videos for <i>Norman Fucking Rockwell </i>in 2019. The track is one of the lighter airy ones on the record so we felt this was the best way to convey the energy of the song.

                    In may of 2023, my dad and I went to Montrose Harbor, played with some new wide angle lenses and
                    took photos. I shot video there and decided to make a short clip with it. It was a fun exercise in
                    color grading and format.

                        This was my first attempt at making a music video. Looking back even though it has been only three
                        years, there's a lot I would do differently. But I feel it is important to include in this
                        portfolio because it still shows progress. I also had a really fun time doing
                        it with my friend Paige.
