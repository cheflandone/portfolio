                I’ve been making these for years. But in 2021 my world imploded, as it does for many 19 year olds. This
                led to a very intense and eventful year in 2022 which prompted me to take this form of documentary and
                not just make it a corny montage, but turn it into an art piece itself. Playing with composition and
                building a cinematic experience that captures what it really is to be ‘coming of age’ in the 21st
                century. <br /><br />

                As someone who is really dorky with technical stuff like video encoding and audio mixing I use this as
                an exercise to practice and perfect the quality of these short films.<br /><br />

                This is my passion project, my thesis, and my legacy. I want to take these memories and present it how I
                feel it. A glorious kaleidoscope of love, liberation, and the fear that comes with growing into
                yourself.<br /><br />

                In 2023, I spent the entire year intently recording moments + b-roll like scenery to build a more
                cohesive narrative + setting. I divided it up into chapters signifying important moments in my life.
                <br />For example, a few were things like, moving to a very queer neighborhood, beginning a
                relationship, and ending the relationship when I realized I had to stand up for myself, the liberation
                that followed, a difficult semester in school that led to serious burnout. These were things that mean a
                lot to me on a personal level.

                In may of 2023, my dad and I went to Montrose Harbor, played with some new wide angle lenses and took
                photos. I shot video there and decided to make a short clip with it. It was a fun exercise in color
                grading and format.

                This was my first attempt at making a music video. Looking back even though it has been only two years,
                there's a lot I would do differently. But I feel it is important to include in this portfolio because it
                still shows I'm capable of these things. I also had a really fun time doing it with my friend Paige.
                We're discussing making more and that excites me :)
