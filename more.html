                    Well, my life and the foreseeable future I was trying so hard to construct has not only disappeared
                    in front of my eyes, but it went up in violent flames. An in depth explanation on my life/career
                    lately can be watched <a style="color: #606060" href="https://youtu.be/veT0DtL-FC4">here</a>. I took a new job so I could pay for a place to sleep. At first I felt
                    like a sellout because I was changing my focus and diverting my energy and time to a career that was
                    not a creative one. But I quickly checked myself. It was this or be homeless lmfao. However I refuse
                    to complain, I got an incredible job that’s going to bring a lot of opportunity I can’t even fathom
                    yet. I just wish I could stop spending so much time trying to survive so I could actually foster my
                    creative ambitions. It’s getting better though, and it is truly thrilling to be getting through to
                    the other end of the tunnel. <br><br> The new Lorde record came at a perfect time. There is nothing more
                    cathartic than listening to something that you can relate to, arrive when needed most. <br><br>
                    TTFN, Landon.

                    Reflecting on the last year isn’t easy. It’s kind of jarring how much can happen in 365 days. I
                    could write some this and that on my reflection. But you can watch/hear/feel that
                    <a style="color: #606060" href="video.html">here.</a> So, what now? I’ve hit the ground running,
                    faster than ever. I’m not counting my eggs before they hatch because not once has that gone well,
                    but, I’m pretty optimistic about the road ahead. Going into working independently on a local level.
                    I’m not sure how everyone just gets a salary job right out of school, but it’s cool. If a door won’t
                    open I’m going through the window. I recently just had the privilege of shooting my best friend’s
                    first gig, and it really hit that, we are doing this and we are doing it on our own. Coming to
                    appreciate what indie really means lol. Anyway, here's what I've been listening to lately-

                    This moment right now is a full circle moment. Thinking about how growing up I would make
                    “newsletters’ in Microsoft Publisher and email them to relatives (probably against their will). Then
                    later in my teens when I made my own website that acted as a blog. Looking back, it was really lame
                    and made with a free site creator. But in the moment, that moment, I was reeling in it. Unstoppable.
                    The freedom I felt I had as I documented my early teens and created an image for myself, an ideal,
                    about working in creative careers. I was met with many walls like not having the tools to create the
                    things I wanted. But I persevered because it was all I could do. Not a single soul looked at the
                    site other than myself and probably my mom like twice. But I was laying the groundwork since an
                    early age. When I was even younger I would make little pretend businesses and make branding for
                    them. But back to my point. This is the full circle moment. As I write on this site, that I made by
                    HAND and not some site maker thing. I’m creating what I want exactly how I want. I’m sharing the
                    thoughts in my head. The ideas. It feels really fulfilling to know I was able to make the things I
                    felt were not possible over a decade ago.
